features:
  - icon: 🛡️
    title: Type-safe with Schema Validation
    details: Runtime validation with Zod, Valibot, ArkType, and other Standard Schema libraries. Ensure data integrity at every operation.

  - icon: 🔮
    title: Automatic Type Inference
    details: Full TypeScript support with schema-based type inference across all operations. No manual type definitions needed.

  - icon: ⚛️
    title: Atomic Operations
    details: Perform multiple operations in a single transaction with optimistic locking and automatic rollback on conflicts.

  - icon: 👀
    title: Real-time Updates
    details: Watch keys for changes with the reactive watch() API. Get notified immediately when values change.

  - icon: 🔌
    title: Pluggable Storage Drivers
    details: Built on SQLite with a driver architecture designed for extensibility. Custom drivers are already accessible by passing a driver function to the public `open()` API and via the `driverFn` option in factory methods. More built-in drivers coming soon.

  - icon: 🔒
    title: Multi-instance Safe
    details: Proper concurrency control and version tracking for safe access from multiple processes or instances.

  - icon: 🚀
    title: Serialization Options
    details: Choose from JSON, V8, BSON, MessagePack, or CBOR serializers based on your performance and compatibility needs.

  - icon: 📦
    title: Factory Methods
    details: Simplify instance creation with built-in factory methods for common use cases. Start coding faster.

  - icon: 🎯
    title: Developer Experience
    details: Intuitive API design with excellent error messages, comprehensive docs, and TypeScript-first development.

## Quick Start

Install Valkeyrie in your project:

::: code-group
```bash [npm]
npm install valkeyrie
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add valkeyrie
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add valkeyrie
```
:::

Create a type-safe key-value store with schema validation:

```typescript
import { Valkeyrie } from 'valkeyrie'
import { z } from 'zod'

// Define your schema with Zod (or Valibot, ArkType, etc.)
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().min(0)
})

// Register the schema and open the database
const db = await Valkeyrie
  .withSchema(['users', '*'], userSchema)
  .open('./my-data.db')

// Set a value - automatically validated!
await db.set(['users', 'alice'], {
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  age: 30
})

// Get the value - fully typed!
const user = await db.get(['users', 'alice'])
// user.value type: { name: string, email: string, age: number } | null

// List all users with prefix
for await (const entry of db.list({ prefix: ['users'] })) {
  console.log('User:', entry.value)
}

// Watch for changes
for await (const entries of db.watch([['users', 'alice']])) {
  console.log('User updated:', entries[0].value)
}
```

## Why Valkeyrie?

Valkeyrie brings the best of both worlds: the simplicity of key-value stores and the safety of runtime schema validation.

### 🔐 Runtime Safety

Never trust input data again. Valkeyrie validates every value against your schema at runtime, catching bugs before they become problems.

### 💎 Type Inference Magic

Define your schema once, get TypeScript types everywhere. No more maintaining parallel type definitions.

### ⚡ Atomic Transactions

Modify multiple keys in a single atomic operation with automatic conflict resolution. No more race conditions.

### 🎨 Flexible Serialization

Choose the serializer that fits your needs:
- **JSON**: Maximum compatibility
- **V8**: Best performance for Node.js
- **BSON, MessagePack, CBOR**: Efficient binary formats
